Code up the comparisons between subsequent versions

Short-Term

Remove vote tracking code and replace with bin packages tracking code for each matchup so as to correctly account for multi-bin src comparisons
Obtain per-release or timeseries data on popularity
Do a regression to explain popularity differences (ln(P2) = Rln(P1) + BX + E) where X is the amount of code differences
